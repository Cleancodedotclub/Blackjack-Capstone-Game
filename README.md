The Python Blackjack Capstone GitHub repository contains code for a command-line interface (CLI) version of the classic casino card game, Blackjack. The game is built entirely in Python and uses object-oriented programming (OOP) principles.

The repository consists of several files, including a main game file, a file containing classes for the game's cards, and a file with functions for user input and display. The game supports up to 7 players and includes features such as betting, hit, stand, split, and insurance options.

In addition to the basic gameplay, the repository also includes some advanced features, such as a card counting system, to help players gain an edge over the dealer.
